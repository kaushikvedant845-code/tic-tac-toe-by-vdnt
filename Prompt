Build a Tic Tac Toe grid in HTML/CSS with styled buttons that change color when clicked, design a modern interactive ui , add some animations when game ends and player win / loose, add some background animation in slow pace, also designing it more interesting by making dynamic animation when game starting and winning , in background add some minimal effects while playing but should be smooth and a soothing vibe.  



 also before starting the game add two options of grid selection  

 1st option- 3x3 grid  

 2nd option - 5x5 grid  

 and on the same page as a multitask add 3 options for game theme . 

 where theme means ,based on game background & overall look like  

 1st option - dark and agrresive gamer style and intense animation but not the overdone   

 2nd option - light and lovable theme style for minimal and soothing style animations in pace and to lighten up the mood relaxing. 

 3rd option - normal animated background in slow pace should be minimal too background should be soothing but not more than 2nd option.  

 and also add one more button on the right top - for night mode . when turned on then theme gets dark for night and when off theme gets light for day mode .  by deffault keep it off AND let user select if want to.

Also add one more button go back to home page whenever the player want to go  back to home page ,  but when player select the button for home page then before redirecting it to go there show a popup if "are you sure to go back"  "yes/No"  and make larger icons for tic tac
